    Parameters
    ----------
    state: array-like
      Represents the state of the MDP before taking an action. In most
      cases this will be a numpy array.
    action: int, float, tuple
      For discrete action domains this will be an integer. For
      continuous action domains this will be a floating point
      number. For a parameterized action MDP this will be a tuple
      containing the action and its associated parameters.
    reward: float
      The reward received for executing the given action in the given
      state and transitioning to the resulting state.
    next_state: array-like
      This is the state the agent transitions to after executing the
      `action` in `state`. Expected to be the same type/dimensions as
      the state.
    is_terminal: boolean

class Preprocessor:

    This is a suggested interface for the preprocessing steps. You may

    Preprocessor can be used to perform some fixed operations on the
    raw state from an environment. For example, in ConvNet based
    networks which use image as the raw state, it is often useful to
    convert the image to greyscale or downsample the image.

    Preprocessors are implemented as class so that they can have
    internal state. This can be useful for things like the
    AtariPreproccessor which maxes over k frames.

    If you're using internal states, such as for keeping a sequence of
    inputs like in Atari, you should probably call reset when a new
    episode begins so that state doesn't leak in from episode to
    episode.

class ReplayMemory:
    """Interface for replay memories.

    We have found this to be a useful interface for the replay
    memory. Feel free to add, modify or delete methods/attributes to
    this class.

    It is expected that the replay memory has implemented the
    __iter__, __getitem__, and __len__ methods.

    If you are storing raw Sample objects in your memory, then you may
    not need the end_episode method, and you may want to tweak the
    append method. This will make the sample method easy to implement
    (just ranomly draw saamples saved in your memory).

    However, the above approach will waste a lot of memory (as states
    will be stored multiple times in s as next state and then s' as
    state, etc.). Depending on your machine resources you may want to
    implement a version that stores samples in a more memory efficient
    manner.

    Methods
    -------
    append(state, action, reward, debug_info=None)
      Add a sample to the replay memory. The sample can be any python
      object, but it is suggested that tensorflow_rl.core.Sample be
      used.
    end_episode(final_state, is_terminal, debug_info=None)
      Set the final state of an episode and mark whether it was a true
      terminal state (i.e. the env returned is_terminal=True), of it
      is is an artificial terminal state (i.e. agent quit the episode
      early, but agent could have kept running episode).
    sample(batch_size, indexes=None)
      Return list of samples from the memory. Each class will
      implement a different method of choosing the
      samples. Optionally, specify the sample indexes manually.
    clear()
      Reset the memory. Deletes all references to the samples.
